Heart Disease Analysis Report by SPSS
## 1. About Heart Disease
The report investigates heart disease by analyzing biological and lifestyle factors, emphasizing variables such as age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain. The key objective is to identify factors that predict the likelihood of heart disease and assess their hierarchy of influence.

- Key findings highlight the significance of certain factors:
  - Chest pain (cp) is identified as the most impactful predictor.
  - Other critical variables include the number of major vessels (caa), maximum heart rate (thalachh), exercise-induced angina (oldpeak), and thalassemia (thall).
## 2. Survey Overview
The dataset contains information on 303 individuals, with no missing values. It includes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle-related variables to facilitate comprehensive analysis:

 - **Variables**: Age, gender, chest pain, cholesterol levels, exercise stress, and others.
 - **Purpose**: Explore correlations between these factors and heart disease risk.
 - **Hypothesis**:
    - Null hypothesis (H₀): Independent factors do not significantly explain the risk of heart disease.
    - Alternative hypothesis (H₁): At least one predictor has a significant influence.

## 3. Key Research Problems:
 - **Exploring Effects of Lifestyle and Biological Factors**:
Investigating how age, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced angina contribute to heart disease.
Assessing gender-specific influences on heart disease risk.
 - **Understanding Chest Pain Types**:
 Analyzing the relationship between chest pain categories and heart disease risk.
Evaluating if specific chest pain types correlate strongly with other conditions, like higher cholesterol or blood pressure.
 - **Risk Stratification**:
Identifying high-risk groups using variable combinations (age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
Defining thresholds for risk indicators such as "old peak" or maximum heart rate ("thalachh").
 - **Analyzing Feature Interactions**:
Examining how the combination of features like cholesterol and thalassemia jointly affects heart disease risk.
## 4. KPI (Key Performance Indicators)
The study focuses on key performance metrics for assessing variable influence:
 - **Significance Values**: Chest pain (0.001), thalachh (0.010), oldpeak (0.022), caa (0.001), and thall (0.009).
 - **Adjusted R²**: 41.7% of the variance in the outcome is explained by independent factors.
 - **Beta Values**: Ranked in terms of impact on predicting heart disease:
                                                                       cp (0.222), caa (-0.197), thalachh (0.187), oldpeak (-0.158), thall (-0.146).
