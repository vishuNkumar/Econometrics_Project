Heart Disease Analysis Report by SPSS
## 1. About Heart Disease
The report investigates heart disease by analyzing biological and lifestyle factors, emphasizing variables such as age, cholesterol levels, and chest pain. The key objective is to identify factors that predict the likelihood of heart disease and assess their hierarchy of influence.

- Key findings highlight the significance of certain factors:
  - Chest pain (cp) is identified as the most impactful predictor.
  - Other critical variables include the number of major vessels (caa), maximum heart rate (thalachh), exercise-induced angina (oldpeak), and thalassemia (thall).
## 2. Survey Overview
The dataset contains information on 303 individuals, with no missing values. It includes demographic, clinical, and lifestyle-related variables to facilitate comprehensive analysis:

 - **Variables**: Age, gender, chest pain, cholesterol levels, exercise stress, and others.
 - **Purpose**: Explore correlations between these factors and heart disease risk.
 - **Hypothesis**:
    - Null hypothesis (H₀): Independent factors do not significantly explain the risk of heart disease.
    - Alternative hypothesis (H₁): At least one predictor has a significant influence.
